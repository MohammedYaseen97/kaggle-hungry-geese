My solution to solve a live Reinforcement Learning Problem on Kaggle - [Hungry Geese](https://www.kaggle.com/c/hungry-geese).

My rank : 287/423 (and changing constantly)

## About The Live Problem: 
Whether it be in an arcade, on a phone, as an app, on a computer, or maybe stumbled upon in a web search, many of us have likely developed fond memories playing a version of Snake. It’s addicting to control a slithering serpent and watch it grow along the grid until you make one… wrong… move. Then you have to try again because surely you won’t make the same mistake twice!

With Hungry Geese, Kaggle has taken this classic in the video game industry and put a multi-player, simulation spin to it. You will create an AI agent to play against others and survive the longest. You must make sure your goose doesn’t starve or run into other geese; it’s a good thing that geese love peppers, donuts, and pizza—which show up across the board.

Extensive research exists in building Snake models using reinforcement learning, Q-learning, neural networks, and more (maybe you’ll use… Python?). Take your grid-based reinforcement learning knowledge to the next level with this exciting new challenge!

## Approach
In my approach, i have shown a Greedy model vs Q-Learning model with a lot of help from [Victor de la Fuente's Model](https://www.kaggle.com/victordelafuente/hungrygeese-q-learning-common-sense-knowledge). Tried my best to improve on it.. i'm guessing i did just a little bit :)
